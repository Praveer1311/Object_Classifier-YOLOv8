# Object_Classifier-YOLOv8
Built an object classification system using YOLOv8, detecting objects in images and displaying them with color-coded bounding boxes and confidence scores. The model uses CNNs for accurate predictions, applies non-maximum suppression, and ensures clean results with optimized bounding box localization.
